                            **berrySmart: Final Report**
                            **Nikhil Murthy, Gabriella Garcia, Sunny Tran and Irin Ghosh**

Farming accounts for 70% of the world’s water consumption, with many over watering their crops, while one-fifth of the world's population lacks safe drinking water. This issue primarily stems from a lack of understanding of what individual plants require in terms of water, fertilizer, sunlight and pesticides. 

The berrySmart device gives farmers a way to better understand their farm. A variety of sensors are strategically placed across the farm, the values of which are POSTed to a central database. We then create a dashboard for farmers that highlight these sensor values along with recommendations based off of them.

This project uses various sensors (soil moisture, temperature, light, humidity) placed in three high priority areas in the farm. Working as nodes in a WiFi overlayed mesh network, each node communicates the location’s data to a central database. The central databases’ data is then analyzed on a dashboard accessible to farmers.


Market
===============================================================================

Our target market is small-scale family or community owned farms. We focus on a variety of berry crops as they are one of the largest agricultural exports for the Northeastern area. The berrySmart device fulfills the need for agricultural efficiency and data analysis for middle-income, low technology farms.  

Berry farming has a variety environmental requirements. Blueberries require acidic soil (4.8 to 5.2) that must be monitored. Berries are high water and high sunlight crops, requiring an abundant supply of high-quality water delivered at the right rate, time and location. Strawberries are particularly sensitive to overcrowding of soil beds and demand consistent pruning and weeding. The use of extensive data collection and analysis in the berrySmart device will enable farmers to better understand and grow their crops.

System Overview
===============================================================================

Our berrySmart system consists of subsystems including sensor nodes (Section 2.1), an edge node (Section 2.2), database (Section 2.3), dashboard (Section 2.4) and the farmer's laptop, which is used to view the dashboard. An overview of our system is below:

![Figure [system]: The berrySmart system, which includes sensors that communicate through an overlay mesh network over WiFi, a central database and a dashboard that is presented to the farmer.

We will now discuss the various components of berrySmart.

Sensor Nodes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sensor nodes are made up of an ESP, battery and sensors that measure soil moisture, temperature, humidity and ambient light. They are placed throughout the farm (in our case, three positions), and collect sensor values.

Each sensor node is not connected to the Internet directly; rather, it communicates with other sensor nodes in a mesh network. An edge node (Section 2.2) communicates all information to the central server and database (Section 2.3).

Sensor nodes collect information once every 10 minutes, and otherwise put in deep sleep to conserve power. The sensor nodes are designed to last long periods of times without being connected to a power source, as fully described in Section 6: Power Management. 

Leaf Nodes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The leaf node is a sensor node in the mesh network that does not recieve data from another nodes; in other words, leaf nodes only send data. Leaf nodes still sleep, collect data and send its own collected data to other nodes in the network.

Edge Node
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The edge node is one sensor node in the mesh network that has the additional functionality of connecting to a WiFi network, such as a hotspot in the farmer's home. This allows our mesh network to communicate with the outside world, specifically sending information to our database (Section 2.3).

Database
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

berrySmart utilizes two databases and many Handlers to keep track of sensor information, analytics, recommendations and website info. strawberry.db is the central database for sensor readings. login.db is the database that stores the logins and passwords of each dashboard user, ensuring that the dashboard is personalised for each farmer. 

Various Handlers were created such as all_dataHandler.py for reformatting the data into the appropriate formats, berryHandler_v2 for testing the Wifi mesh network, strawberryHandler.py for performing get and pull requests to the strawberry.db database and loginhandler.py for registering an account and logging in users using the login.db database. Additional handlers were implemented for GET requests for the two types of mean and standard deviation: individual mean per sensor node and overall mean for the whole farm system. The dashboard current weather section implemented handlers that directly contacted the openweathermap api to generate the cloud, humidity, sunrise, sunset, temperature, weather, weather icon and wind data.

Dashboard
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The berrySmart dashboard summarizes sensor data and recommendations visually. We provide maps of the farm with sensor information overlayed, which allow farmers to easily understand the state of their crops. We include current weather conditions paired with recommendations based off of sensor information, such as whether plants should be watered (depending on the type of crop, weather and soil moisture sensor data). :

System: Implementation
===============================================================================

We will now discuss how we implemented berrySmart's system (as outlined in Section 2). 

Parts List
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We used external parts, namely sensors, in addition to the provided parts to create berrySmart:

| Part                            | Item Number            | Description                                             | Amount |
|---------------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| Soil Moisture Sensor            | Amazon ASIN:B07H3P1NRM | Monitor the amount of moisture in the soil of the plant | 3      |
| Temperature and Humidity Sensor | Amazon ASIN:B01DKC2GQ0 | Sensors for humidity and temperature                    | 3      |
| Photoresistor                   | N/A (from lab)         | Monitor amount of light received by the plant           | 3      |


Sensor Implementation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We collect sensor information once every 10 minutes.

### Soil Moisture

The soil moisture sensors uses Analog to communicate. We connected the sensor to analog port 14.

We developed a calibration procedure to accurately determine the soil moisture at any given point using the following formula:

$$soil\_moisture = \frac{moisture\_upper}{moisture\_upper - moisture\_lower} - \frac{analogRead(A14)/4096.0}{moisture\_upper - moisture\_lower}$$

where $soil\_moisture$ is the soil moisture, $moisture\_upper$ is the upper limit of the soil moisture, $moisture\_lower$ is the lower limit of the soil moisture and $analogread(A14)$ is the analog voltage reading of the sensor. $moisture\_upper$ and $moisture\_lower$ are determined through our calibration process, where we first measure the sensor in air (when it is dry), and set that to $moisture\_upper$, and then place the sensor in a cup of water, and set that value to $moisture\_lower$.

This calibration process allows $soil\_moisture$ to be 1 when the voltage (analogRead(A14)/4096.0) is at the lower limit ($moisture\_lower$), and 0 when the voltage is equal to $moisture\_upper$. 

### Temperature and Humidity

To measure temperature and humidity, we utilized the DHT library (Resource 1), and connected the sensor to port 19 on the ESP. We create a DHT object, as defined in the DHT library, and use its temperature and humidity fields to update our readings. 

### Photoresistor

We use a photoresistor to measure ambient light. The sensor is connected to Analog port 7, and we subtract its voltage from 1 to get its measured brightness:

$$brightness = 1 - \frac{analogRead(A7)}{4096.0}$$

## State Machine: Sensor Node

Our FSM for a sensor node is outlined below. Once the condition for the corresponding arrow is met, the sensor moves to the next state. Otherwise, the node remains at its current state.

![Figure [sensor fsm]: This implementation allows for the sensor to sleep for 10 minutes. This node is capable of receiving, collecting and sending packets of data.
](./images/fsm_sensor.png width="600px" border="0")

## State Machine: Leaf Node

Our FSM for a leaf node is outlined below. The FSM of a leaf node differs from that of a sensor node in that a leaf node cannot receive data packets. Rather, its sole purpose is to collect data packets and send it to the adjacent sensor node.

![Figure [leaf fsm]: This implementation allows for the sensor to sleep for 10 minutes. This node is capable of collecting and sending packets of data.
](./images/fsm_leaf.png width="600px" border="0")


## WiFi Protocol

In order to achieve the mesh network overlayed with WiFi, we instantiate WiFi signals which connect between adjacent nodes. These WiFi connections are instantiated every time the device wakes up and is ready to receive data, and it is deinitialized once the device has received the data packet. We store the data in a character array, where subsequent data packets from different ESP devices are separated in the character array by a hashtag (#). 

Leaf nodes do not receive data packets, while sensor nodes and edge nodes do, and they relay the data to the next ESP device. Currently, the connections between nodes are hard-coded. However, future iterations could utilize the GPS location of each ESP to determine an optimal path for the packet to traverse to reach the edge node. The edge node is the sole connection in our mesh which is connected to the internet. All packets will be required to go through the edge node in order to be received by the database. Again, future iterations of this mesh could utilize multiple edge nodes to optimally deliver packets of data.

In addition, the WiFi range of the ESP is approximately $63$ feet.

## Sleeping

For our sleeping implementation, we decided to put the ESP into Deep Sleep. We chose this over Hibernation, because Deep Sleep allowed for us to utilize the RTC memory storage to retain information over time. We make the ESP go to sleeo by first enabling the sleep timer with esp_sleep_enable_timer_wakeup($time in microseconds$) and then putting it to deep sleep with esp_deep_sleep_start(). Both of these functions are already defined within the ESP core.

We used an RTC_DATA_ATTR object to store the packet number of each data packet in order to determine if our mesh network dropped any packets over time. Our current implementation has the ESP sleeping for 10 minutes after sending a data packet. Lengthening the sleeping time will improve battery performance.

## Dashboard: Graphs
There are two types of dynamic graphs on the dashboard: mapped graphs and scatter plots. Plotly is used as a platform to create the graphics due to its clean, minimalist aesthetics and potential to add dynamic features. The data is pulled through a GET Request from our central database and then stripped into the appropriate parameters and formats. Our goal is to have a clean, easy to read visualisation of the data to help farmers see the performance and data of each of their sensor nodes/plots.

Scatter Plots display classic data visualisation to farmers. Each graph contains overlayed subplots of each of the sensor node's readings over time (minutes since reading). The graphs are dynamic, enabling the user to scroll over the plots, zoom in and click on points. Beneath each scatter plot are the averages for each sensor node. We have four scatter plots per parameter tested: temperature, humidity, soil moisture and light.

Mapped Graphs overlay the most recent data points on a Mapbox API generated satellite image of the farmer's farm. The GPS coordinates are generated from the individual coordinates of each sensor node, enabling the farmer to see the exact network formation of the system on real time satellite imagery. The data is visualised as large circles over each sensor node, colored by an autoscaled preset colorscale that will range the colors based on previus readings. For example, if the average temperature is approximately 24 degrees Celsius, 24.1 degrees will be colored white while a temperature of 24.9 degrees will be colored red due to the stark contrast between the values based on the average. In addition, the plotted circles display the actual readings as centered text. We have four mapped graphs per parameter tested: temperature, humidity, soil moisture and light.

A third form of dynamic graph was made: a Filled-Area Animation Scatter plot. These enabled the farmer to press play and watch an animation of the scatter plots over time. Unfortunately, the plots took too long to generate when embedded into the html dashboard and would therefore not load and crash the website. There were four animated scatter plots per parameter tested: temperature, humidity, soil moisture and light.

## Dashboard: HTML/JavaScript
The webpage makes use of HTML, CSS and Javascript. Bootstrap has been for styling because of its professional look. The BerrySmart webpage has a fixed vertical navbar (scroll-spy) which indicates the section of the webpage the user is in. On opening the webpage a modal shows up which asks for a username (unique) and password to give a personalized feel to the user. The first section is a drop down list, where the user can select a parameter and on selecting the corresponding mapped plot (described above) appears. The second section is a weather panel which shows the descriptions (pictorial and textual) of the current weather and gives other parameters related to the weather. This is done by sending GET requests through AJAX to Open Weather API. 

The third section is the Statistics which is linked to the scatter plot generated in Plotly described above. The areawise/plotwise average and standard deviation has been shown for all the four parameters. The backend comprises of sending GET requests to Python handlers which can communicated with the database. The fourth section has a table with specific recommendations for growing strawberries and another table with the same parameters for the user's farm/garden to enable them to compare. 

The fifth section is an alerts pane which gives dismissable warnings to the user if any parameter is out of range for a particular plot and gives specific suggestions to fix the same in a box below as a list. This is also implemented through Python handlers. The last section has a link to the location of MIT, a Carousel of sliding images and email address of the four of us which automatically connects to an email app (like Outlook, Apple Mail). Glyphicons (little symbols/ icons) which is open source has been used in our web. All the dynamic features of the webpage (eg. graphs apperaing on cliking and communiaction with APIs, handlers) is implemented using JavaScript and AJAX.



## Daily Digest
As an additional feature, we created a Daily Digest for the farmer. In case the user does not check their dashboard on a daily basis, Berry Smart sends an automatic email containing a "Today's Scoop" newsletter displaying the averaged plot health statistics for each parameter. This email pulls the average over all the sensor nodes from our database using a GET request, ensuring that the data is up to date. The email is created by overlaying text and data on a base image created using Canva. This email is then sent automatically using a Python script to all members of the berry-smart@mit.edu mailing list.

## Analytics
For the dashboard's Statistics, Recommendations and Alerts sections, we implemented analytics to provide data-based suggestions for the farmer. We calculated the mean and standard deviation for each of the sensor nodes as well as the mean and standard deviation for all of the sensor nodes together using imported numpy and statistics. In this iteration of the product, we pre-set recommended values for each of the parameters based on the optimal conditions for strawberry farming. So the optimal temperature is between 60 degrees and 80 degrees Fahrenheit with direct sunlight as an optimal state. In the future, we intend to allow the farmer to designate which crops they are growing in each plot and then pull the optimal conditions for each crop from our database. Based on these recommended values, the Alerts section displays low/high level alerts based on each sensor node's averaged readings. These are specifically the averaged readings of the past couple of hours. If the light level in sensor node 2 is on average about 0.1, the alerts section will display "Low light levels in area(s) 2".

Based on the appearance of alerts, suggestions are displayed for the user. In a future iteration, these recommendations will be crop specific. Currently the possible suggestions include:

Low Soil Moisture: "Your plots aren't getting enough water, please water plants in area(s) xxx."

Low Light : "Your plots aren't getting enough light, please remove items that are causing shade or install additional light sources such as lamps in area(s) xxx."

Low / High Humidity: “Your area does not have the appropriate humidity for your plots,  slow down ventilation rates and adjust watering to accommodate humidity in area(s) xxx."

Low / High Temperature: "Your area does not have the appropriate temperature for your plots, consider changing your heating system in area(s) xxx."

## Code: Functions and Classes

### Mesh Network

Our working mesh network implementation utilizes the code in the wifi_sensor folder.

#### esp32_edge

setup(): 

- Instantiates serial monitor

loop():

- Transitions between being in the state of being a client and a server

- loop() calls on helper functions addToBuffer() and post()

- After sending the packet, the ESP then goes to sleep via a process as outlined in Section 3.6

addToBuffer():

- This function instantiates a temporary buffer which stores the incoming data

- The temporary buffer is then added to the buffer which we use to store all data packets

- This buffer is a character array which stores incoming data packets

post():

- post() appends the first element of the data buffer to the body of the https post request and then sends the data via the internet

- It is in this function that the ESP calculates its own sensor readings, appends it to the outgoing data packet and sends it

emptyBuffer():

- This function empties the buffer after every post request

#### esp32_leaf

setup():

- Begins the WiFi soft AP

loop():

- If the ESP has found a client, the ESP calculates its sensor readings and passes that data packet to the connecting node.

- After delaying for $500ms$, we stop the connection and put the ESP to sleep

#### esp32_intermediate

setup():

- Instantiates serial monitor 

loop():

- Similar to the edge node, the loop function transitions between receiving and sending data

- When it is in the state of receiving data packets, it looks for a WiFi with a client_ssid and client_password which we hard code into the ESP

- Once a connection is established, the ESP runs addToBuffer(), which appends the incoming data packet to a buffer in the ESP

- During the process of sending data packets from this intermediate node, this node instantiates a WiFi access point connection, which is done in sendingSetup()

- After setting up the AP, loop() calls sendingBuffer(), then it sleeps

sendingBuffer():

- This ESP looks for a connection to pass the packet to, where the connection it is looking for has been hard coded

- Once a connection is established, this function concatenates the incoming packet with a hashtag (#) and its own sensor reading values

- After concatenation, it sends the data packet with its own sensor values and clears the buffer

### Server

The server folder deals with all parsing of data, analytics and visualisations.

#### Handlers

##### strawberryHandler.py

This file sets up the SQL strawberry.db database with text and timestamp as fields. Performs GET and POST requests based on the 'method' of the request. During GET requests, selects items by descending order of the timestamp, if there are less than 1 item in the database, returns "Not enough values are in the database".

##### all_dataHandler.py

This file parses the text format of the strawberryHandler using a get request. Uses a for loop, conversion of string to dictionary and list additions organise the data based on sensor node/esp number. Returns a list containing : temp1, temp2, temp3, humid1, humid2, humid3, light1, light2, light3, moist1, moist2, moist3. Where temp1 is the set of temperature values at esp 1. 

##### berryHandler.py

Our initial database and request handler that sets up the SQL berry.db database with latitude, longitude, temperature, humidity, light and timing fields. Performs GET and POST requests with a table visualisation of the fake data in Week1. (not used in final demo)

##### berryHandler_v2.py

Identical to berryHandler.py but with soil moisture as a field and without table representation of the database. (not used in final demo)

##### blueberry_Handler.py

This file sets up the SQL blueberry.db database with text and timestamp as fields. Performs same function as strawberryHandler.py but was used in initial bluetooth testing when sending "blueberries" between two esps. (not used in final demo)

#### mapgraphs

##### berry_mapbox_humid.py & berry_mapbox_temp.py & berry_mapbox_light.py & berry_mapbox_moist.py

These files create the mapped graphics for each of the tested parameters. They incorporate the same functions and structure but pass in their own parameter as data.

First, the parsed data from all_dataHandler.py is pulled using a GET request. This data is then used to create a major list containing the parameter data for each plot. For example the humid list incorporates humid1 (data[3]) , humid2 (data[4]) , and humid3 (data[5]) . A list of fake coordinates was generated from a tulip farm in the Netherlands using Google Maps. These coordinates are then appended to a latitude and longitude list of equal length to the humid list. Therefore, the first, fourth, seventh, etc items in humid would correspond to the first pair of coordinates and so on. These lists are then converted into a csv file to create a table format used in Plotly. Then, a coloscale is generated using shades of red and white (for temperature). 

A data list is then created to pass in all the parameters and features Plotly uses for its graphs. These include specifics on marker sizes, fonts, textpositions, etc. The latitude, longitude and parameter data is then passed in the appropriate fields. A layout list is then generated to format the appearance of the plot using parameters such as title and incorporating the mapbox api to generate satellitle imagery based on the coordinates. The data and layout lists are then used to create a figure and plotted using Plotly's online plotting feature. 

#### scatter_plots

##### humid_plots.py, light_plots.py., moist_plots.py, temp_plots.py.

These files create the scatter plots for each of the tested parameters. They incorporate the same functions and structure but pass in their own parameter as data.

First, the parsed data from all_dataHandler.py is pulled using a GET request. Next, three lists are created to pass in the parameter data based on each sensor node. For example, humid1:(data[3]) , humid2:(data[4]) , and humid3:(data[5]) are created. Next, a list of time values is created of equal length to the size of the data set using values spaced by 10, as each data point is read and posted every 10 minutes. Three scatter plots are created using the sensor nodes specific sensor readings. These are then added into a subplot so each scatter plot is mapped on the same graph. Finally, a layout list is generated to organise the plot and set the xaxis title, yaxis title, etc. A figure is then generated and plotted using Plotly's online plotting feature. 

#### stats

##### all_mean.py

This file creates the average for each parameter over all the sensor nodes. First, the parsed data from all_dataHandler.py is pulled using a GET request. This data is then used to create a major list containing the parameter data for each plot. For example the humid list incorporates humid1 (data[3]) , humid2 (data[4]) , and humid3 (data[5]). Then using an imported statistics module, based on the passed in integer in the GET function, we return the average of the parameter. For example, if we passed in k=1, we return the rounded to two decimal places average of temperature converted to Fahrenheit.

##### all_std.py

This file is identical to all_mean.py but instead, returns the standard deviation.

##### plot_mean.py

This file creates the average for each parameter for each sensor node. First, the parsed data from all_dataHandler.py is pulled using a GET request. This data is then used to create three lists to pass in the parameter data based on each sensor node. For example, humid1:(data[3]) , humid2:(data[4]) , and humid3:(data[5]) are created. Then using an imported statistics module, based on the passed in integer in the GET function, we return the average of the each sensor node's parameter. For example, if we passed in k=1, we return the rounded to two decimal places average of the temperature in sensor node 1, converted to Fahrenheit.

##### plot_std.py

This file is identical to all_mean.py but instead, returns the standard deviation.

#### email_newsletter.py

This file creates the "Daily Scoop" newsletter sent by email to members of the berry-smart mailing list. First, a base image of the newsletter was designed in Canva. Then, the all_mean.py data was pulled using a GET request. Using an imported imghr module, text was overlayed on top of the image to fill in the data in the empty text fields. Then using an imported variety of email smtplib modules, the image was added to the body of the email and then sent from an external email.

Design Challenges
===============================================================================

## Bluetooth

Bluetooth was most certainly one of our biggest design challenges. Initially, we envisioned our mesh network to be overlayed on top of BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy). However, BLE on ESP32 does not have thorough documentation and is still being developed, which made setting up the mesh network over Bluetooth very tedious and difficult. There were many roadblocks to including its undocumented service and characteristic UUID system (unique keys identifying services and characteristics) as well as memory issues, as we needed to import both WiFi and BLE libraries. 

We spent 3 weeks, or 75% of the project, working through bugs with Bluetooth before switching to WiFi, which took us only a few days to get working. We also noticed that our initial tests with Bluetooth found it very unrealiable, dropping upwards of 75% of our data packets. We achieve a much lower drop rate when using WiFi. 

## Graphing

Graphics and visualisations proved to be a little tricky. While Plotly does have very basic instructionals, their documentation is dense and different to traverse. Creating the mapped graphs was the most complicated visualisation due the use of an external mapbox api and lack of clear instructions for even the most basic plots. The conversion to satellite imagery to appear more realistic and overlaying of actual numbers on the plotted circles miraculously worked in the end. Extensive trial and error enabled us to find features and parameters for visualisation that do not appear in Plotly's documentation.


In the beginning, we embedded graphs using html tags given when using Plotly's online server system. Yet, there was a 100 plot generation limit that was rapidly depleted due to debugging, formatting and the large number of plots. Each time the website was refreshed, 8 plots were re-generated. To combat the issue, we were able to download plotly and use its offline plot generation to create figures through divs. These were wrapped in a request handler to be passed into the html. While this worked for a week, as the dashboard became more complex the plots were not generated fast enough and would return failures, crashing the webpage. To resolve this, for the demo we returned to online plots directly embedding the html tags on a separate plotly account. The slow loading speed of the website is still an issue. 

Power Management
===============================================================================

From the ESP32 datasheet, we found that the ESP32 uses:

- 120mA in Active Mode
- 10μA in Deep Sleep Mode

Our current implementation keeps the ESP32 in Active Mode for each packet of data to be received and relayed to the next node, which takes approximately 10 seconds. Afterwards, the ESP32 is put into a Deep Sleep Mode for 10 minutes before waking again to take sensor readings.

We approximate that the ESP32 will consume 1.977 mA on average, by being in Active Mode for 10 seconds and Deep Sleep mode for 10 minutes (600 seconds). With a battery size of 1500 mAh, this device has a projected lifespan of 758.73 hours, or 31.61 days. We can extend the lifespan by decreasing the sampling rate of the device.


Conclusion
===============================================================================

berrySmart utilizes a WiFi overlayed mesh network to communicate sensor values specific to agriculture to a central server, which then presents the information visually in the form of a dashboard.
